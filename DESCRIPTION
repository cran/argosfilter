Description: Filters animal satellite tracking data obtained from the Argos system(<https://www.argos-system.org/>), following the algorithm described in Freitas et al (2008) <doi:10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.00180.x>. It is especially indicated for telemetry studies of marine animals, where Argos locations are predominantly of low-quality.
